# anki-scripting

Various scripts used to create flashcards programmatically

**I no longer use this repository to automate my flashcards.** I published a newer blog post about Anki scripting, [Anki Scripting for Non-programmers](https://www.juliensobczak.com/write/2020/12/26/anki-scripting-for-non-programmers.html) with the companion repository [anki-cli](https://github.com/julien-sobczak/anki-cli). Please check these links before using the code in this repository.
